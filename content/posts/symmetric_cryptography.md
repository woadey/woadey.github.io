## Keyed Permutations
> AES, like all good block ciphers, performs a "keyed permutation". This means that it maps every possible input block to a unique output block, with a key determining which permutation to perform.
>
>Using the same key, the permutation can be performed in reverse, mapping the output block back to the original input block. It is important that there is a one-to-one correspondence between input and output blocks, otherwise we wouldn't be able to rely on the ciphertext to decrypt back to the same plaintext we started with.
>What is the mathematical term for a one-to-one correspondence?

### Solution
`crypto{bijection}`

## Resisting Bruteforce
> If a block cipher is secure, there should be no way for an attacker to distinguish the output of AES from a [random permutation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_permutation) of bits. Furthermore, there should be no better way to undo the permutation than simply bruteforcing every possible key. That's why academics consider a cipher theoretically "broken" if they can find an attack that takes fewer steps to perform than bruteforcing the key, even if that attack is practically infeasible.
>
>It turns out that there is [an attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biclique_attack) on AES that's better than bruteforce, but only slightly – it lowers the security level of AES-128 down to 126.1 bits, and hasn't been improved on for over 8 years. Given the large "security margin" provided by 128 bits, and the lack of improvements despite extensive study, it's not considered a credible risk to the security of AES. But yes, in a very narrow sense, it "breaks" AES.
>
>Finally, while quantum computers have the potential to completely break popular public-key cryptosystems like RSA via [Shor's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm), they are thought to only cut in half the security level of symmetric cryptosystems via [Grover's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover's_algorithm). This is one reason why people recommend using AES-256, despite it being less performant, as it would still provide a very adequate 128 bits of security in a quantum future.
>
>What is the name for the best single-key attack against AES?

### Solution
`crypto{biclique}`

## Structure of AES
>To achieve a keyed permutation that is infeasible to invert without the key, AES applies a large number of ad-hoc mixing operations on the input. This is in stark contrast to public-key cryptosystems like RSA, which are based on elegant individual mathematical problems. AES is much less elegant, but it's very fast.
>
>At a high level, AES-128 begins with a "key schedule" and then runs 10 rounds over a state. The starting state is just the plaintext block that we want to encrypt, represented as a 4x4 matrix of bytes. Over the course of the 10 rounds, the state is repeatedly modified by a number of invertible transformations.
>
>Here's an overview of the phases of AES encryption:
> 
> 1. **KeyExpansion** or Key Schedule
> 
> From the 128 bit key, 11 separate 128 bit "round keys" are derived: one to be used in each AddRoundKey step.
> 
> 2. **Initial key addition**
> 
> *AddRoundKey* - the bytes of the first round key are XOR'd with the bytes of the state.
> 
> 3. **Round** - this phase is looped 10 times, for 9 main rounds plus one "final round"
> 
>  a) *SubBytes* - each byte of the state is substituted for a different byte according to a lookup table ("S-box").
> 
>  b) *ShiftRows* - the last three rows of the state matrix are transposed—shifted over a column or two or three.
> 
>  c) *MixColumns* - matrix multiplication is performed on the columns of the state, combining the four bytes in each column. This is skipped in the final round.
> 
>  d) *AddRoundKey* - the bytes of the current round key are XOR'd with the bytes of the state.
> 
> Included is a `bytes2matrix` function for converting our initial plaintext block into a state matrix. Write a `matrix2bytes` function to turn that matrix back into bytes, and submit the resulting plaintext as the flag.

```python
def bytes2matrix(text):
    """ Converts a 16-byte array into a 4x4 matrix.  """
    return [list(text[i:i+4]) for i in range(0, len(text), 4)]

def matrix2bytes(matrix):
    """ Converts a 4x4 matrix into a 16-byte array.  """
    ????

matrix = [
    [99, 114, 121, 112],
    [116, 111, 123, 105],
    [110, 109, 97, 116],
    [114, 105, 120, 125],
]

print(matrix2bytes(matrix))
```

### Solution
```python
def matrix2bytes(matrix):
    return "".join([chr(n) for lst in matrix for n in lst])
```
```shell {linenos=false}
> print(matrix2bytes(matrix))
crypto{inmatrix}
```

Alternative solution(s):

# source: CryptoHack user @Robin_Jadoul

def matrix2bytes(matrix):
    """ Converts a 4x4 matrix into a 16-byte array.  """
    return bytes(sum(matrix, []))
```

## Round Keys
> We're going to skip over the finer details of the KeyExpansion phase for now. The main point is that it takes in our 16 byte key and produces 11 4x4 matrices called "round keys" derived from our initial key. These round keys allow AES to get extra mileage out of the single key that we provided.
>
>The **initial key addition** phase, which is next, has a single *AddRoundKey* step. The *AddRoundKey* step is straightforward: it XORs the current state with the current round key.
>
>*AddRoundKey* also occurs as the final step of each round. *AddRoundKey* is what makes AES a "keyed permutation" rather than just a permutation. It's the only part of AES where the key is mixed into the state, but is crucial for determining the permutation that occurs.
>
>As you've seen in previous challenges, XOR is an easily invertible operation if you know the key, but tough to undo if you don't. Now imagine trying to recover plaintext which has been XOR'd with 11 different keys, and heavily jumbled between each XOR operation with a series of substitution and transposition ciphers. That's kinda what AES does! And we'll see just how effective the jumbling is in the next few challenges.

## Confusion through Substitution
> The first step of each AES round is SubBytes. This involves taking each byte of the state matrix and substituting it for a different byte in a preset 16x16 lookup table. The lookup table is called a "Substitution box" or "S-box" for short, and can be perplexing at first sight. Let's break it down.
> 
> In 1945 American mathematician Claude Shannon published a groundbreaking paper on Information Theory. It identified "confusion" as an essential property of a secure cipher. "Confusion" means that the relationship between the ciphertext and the key should be as complex as possible. Given just a ciphertext, there should be no way to learn anything about the key.
> 
> If a cipher has poor confusion, it is possible to express a relationship between ciphertext, key, and plaintext as a linear function. For instance, in a Caesar cipher, `ciphertext = plaintext + key`. That's an obvious relation, which is easy to reverse. More complicated linear transformations can be solved using techniques like Gaussian elimination. Even low-degree polynomials, e.g. an equation like `x^4 + 51x^3 + x`, can be solved efficiently using [algebraic methods](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1078515). However, the higher the degree of a polynomial, generally the harder it becomes to solve – it can only be approximated by a larger and larger amount of linear functions.
> 
> The main purpose of the S-box is to transform the input in a way that is resistant to being approximated by linear functions. S-boxes are  aiming for high non-linearity, and while AES's one is not perfect, it's pretty close. The fast lookup in an S-box is a shortcut for performing a very nonlinear function on the input bytes. This function involves taking the modular inverse in the [Galois field 2**8](https://www.samiam.org/galois.html) and then applying an affine transformation which has been tweaked for maximum confusion. The simplest way to express the function is through the following high-degree polynomial:
> 
> diagram showing S-Box equation
> 
> To make the S-box, the function has been calculated on all input values from 0x00 to 0xff and the outputs put in the lookup table.
> 
> Implement `sub_bytes`, send the state matrix through the inverse S-box and then convert it to bytes to get the flag.
