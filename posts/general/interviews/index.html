This naturally requires some interviews. Rather than keeping this to my self, I figured I would publish my review and document my efforts.\nSome of this is a review of basic concepts that I am already familiar with, but there are also areas within the fundamentals that I have missed or just haven’t learned about to the full depth.\nNote: this is more for me than anything else - a majority of this content is catering towards Red Team and Pentesting roles that I have been looking at, but obviously certain topics can be applied to other jobs you maybe looking for.\nMajor Topics Hacker Types (Hats) Black: malicious White: ethical Grey: not malicious, not ethical Green: new, unskilled Blue: vengeful Red: vigilante (A Few) Hacker Roles Pentetration tester Goal: find vulnerabilities in specified time and subset of assests Scope: scoped to system or applications Timeline: a few days to a few weeks Types: Internal: Identify vulnerabilities in an organization’s systems External: Identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited from the outside Cost: generally cheaper than red team due to less time spent Red teamer Goal: test the effectiveness of an organizations defensive strategies Scope: specific objective (exfiltrate financial information) Timeline: 3-4 weeks or longer Types: Internal: focus on the internal network and systems External: focus on the exteral attack surface Hybrid: A combination of the two Cost: generally pricey in comparison to pentest due to time OWASP Top 10 (2021) A01:2021-Broken Access Control moves up from the fifth position; 94% of applications were tested for some form of broken access control. The 34 Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) mapped to Broken Access Control had more occurrences in applications than any other category. A02:2021-Cryptographic Failures shifts up one position to #2, previously known as Sensitive Data Exposure, which was broad symptom rather than a root cause. The renewed focus here is on failures related to cryptography which often leads to sensitive data exposure or system compromise. A03:2021-Injection slides down to the third position. 94% of the applications were tested for some form of injection, and the 33 CWEs mapped into this category have the second most occurrences in applications. Cross-site Scripting is now part of this category in this edition. A04:2021-Insecure Design is a new category for 2021, with a focus on risks related to design flaws. If we genuinely want to “move left” as an industry, it calls for more use of threat modeling, secure design patterns and principles, and reference architectures. A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration moves up from #6 in the previous edition; 90% of applications were tested for some form of misconfiguration. With more shifts into highly configurable software, it’s not surprising to see this category move up. The former category for XML External Entities (XXE) is now part of this category. A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components was previously titled Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities and is #2 in the Top 10 community survey, but also had enough data to make the Top 10 via data analysis. This category moves up from #9 in 2017 and is a known issue that we struggle to test and assess risk. It is the only category not to have any Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVEs) mapped to the included CWEs, so a default exploit and impact weights of 5.0 are factored into their scores. A07:2021-Identification and Authentication Failures was previously Broken Authentication and is sliding down from the second position, and now includes CWEs that are more related to identification failures. This category is still an integral part of the Top 10, but the increased availability of standardized frameworks seems to be helping. A08:2021-Software and Data Integrity Failures is a new category for 2021, focusing on making assumptions related to software updates, critical data, and CI/CD pipelines without verifying integrity. One of the highest weighted impacts from Common Vulnerability and Exposures/Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVE/CVSS) data mapped to the 10 CWEs in this category. Insecure Deserialization from 2017 is now a part of this larger category. A09:2021-Security Logging and Monitoring Failures was previously Insufficient Logging \u0026 Monitoring and is added from the industry survey (#3), moving up from #10 previously. This category is expanded to include more types of failures, is challenging to test for, and isn’t well represented in the CVE/CVSS data. However, failures in this category can directly impact visibility, incident alerting, and forensics. A10:2021-Server-Side Request Forgery is added from the Top 10 community survey (#1). The data shows a relatively low incidence rate with above average testing coverage, along with above-average ratings for Exploit and Impact potential. This category represents the scenario where the security community members are telling us this is important, even though it’s not illustrated in the data at this time.

When an attacker is able to insert a malicious SQL payload within a website field in order to interact with the SQL database. This is due to improper (or lack there of) sanatization of client-side input. Often times this involves having a query that will always be true, such as 1=1 --. HackTricks has quite a few paylaods and descriptions to help.\nWhat is an Open Redirect (Vulnerability)? Open redirects are when a web application allows users to redirect/forward to another URL. Open redirect vulnerabilites can lead to phishing attacks, XSS attacks, SSRF attacks, CSP bypassing, etc.\nWhich cookie security flags exist?\nDifference between Pentest / Vulnerability test?\nDifference between Black/White/Gray box?\nWhat pentest types/techniques exist?\nWhich file upload restrictions are common in web applications?\nSenior Level Content of a good pentest report?\nHow do you detect a CSRF attack?\nHow does XXE payload work?\nWhat is a boolean blind SQLi?\nExplain different HTTP methods, what they are used for, and how to be exploited?\nWhat is a salt?

When an attacker is able to insert a malicious SQL payload within a website field in order to interact with the SQL database. This is due to improper (or lack there of) sanatization of client-side input. Often times this involves having a query that will always be true, such as <code>1=1 --</code>. <a href=https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/sql-injection title=HackTricks target=_blank rel="nofollow noopener">HackTricks</a> has quite a few paylaods and descriptions to help.</p><p><strong>What is an Open Redirect (Vulnerability)?</strong>
Open redirects are when a web application allows users to redirect/forward to another URL.
